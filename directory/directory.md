# Digital Data Flow (DDF) Solution Directory
Welcome to the DDF Solution Directory, here you will find a growing list of self-reported solutions which utilize and follow the DDF Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM). Below you will find a list of solutions which are currently using the USDM and other DDF tools to help promote developing and using fully digitized protocols. Please use this list as a starting point for researching DDF compatible solutions and come back frequently as our list of solutions and use cases grows!
