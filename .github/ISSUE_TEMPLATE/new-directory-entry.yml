        Please read the following instructions before submitting your solution
        
        1. Submit ONE form per solution, for clarity in the published directory we do not want to have multiple solutions under a single line.
        
        2. Solution short descriptions will be truncated to the first 250 characters to preserve formatting in the published directory. Please keep your short descriptions under 250 characters to avoid losing any information. This field will only accept unformatted text, any links, images, or other files submitted will not be parsed and may cause your directyory entry to fail.
        
        3. Solution long descriptions will be stored on the unique page created for your solution; this is your opportunity to provide more context

        5. Please include "https://" in your solution website link URL, to ensure propper formatting in the final directory submission
        
        6. Think of this directory as a virtual brochure or business card which you would give to someone at an in-person event. It should contain enough information to inform them on your product and give an idea of where to reach out to continue the conversation.

        7. Please confirm the information is correct before submitting the form, once submitted it may be difficult to modify your submission with specific updates.
